"Note: Data are from Table 1 of Doleac and Hansen (2020), Avery and Lu (2020), local government websites, law firm websites, and news articles. Columns 3, 4, and 5 denote the effective dates of BTB laws covering public-sector employers, government contractors, and private-sector employers, respectively, except where otherwise noted. *Atlanta, GA removed ""the box'"" from job applications on January 1, 2013 but did not codify it into law until October 6, 2014 (Georgia Justice Project, 2014). As we define treatment using the date of implementation, we consider January 1, 2013 to be the appropriate date. New Haven, CT's law was enacted on February 17, 2009 but we could not find an effective date. We assume that it took effect one month later (March 17, 2009), which would mean by our definition of treatment (in effect on the 15th of the month), the first effective month was April 2009. Fredericksburg, VA's law was enacted on June 5, 2014 but we could not find an effective date. We assume that it took effect one month later (July 5, 2014). It does not matter for our definition of treatment because the enacted and assumed effective dates are both after Washington, D.C. implemented its BTB law.",,,,
